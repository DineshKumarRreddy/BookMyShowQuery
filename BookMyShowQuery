Table Overview
This table will store information about movies, and each row in the table will represent a single movie.
The MovieID uniquely identifies each movie, while the Title provides the name of the movie.

CREATE TABLE Movies (
    MovieID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO Movies (MovieID, Title) VALUES (1, 'Devara'),(2, 'Salar');

Each row in this table represents one theatre, identified by a unique TheatreID, and stores its name (TheatreName) and its geographical location (Location).
CREATE TABLE Theatres (
    TheatreID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    TheatreName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    Location VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO Theatres (TheatreID, TheatreName, Location) VALUES
(1,'City Square Mall', 'Kurnool'),
(2,'Jyothi Mall', 'Hyderabad');

This table represents the number of screens in each theatre, using the primary key from the Theatre table as a foreign key in the Screens table.
CREATE TABLE Screens (
    ScreenID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ScreenNumber INT NOT NULL,
    TheatreID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (TheatreID) REFERENCES Theatre(TheatreID)
);

-- Sample Data
INSERT INTO Screens (ScreenID, ScreenNumber, TheatreID) VALUES
(1, 1, 1),
(2, 2, 1);

The Shows table stores details about specific movie showings, such as the showtime, date, the movie being shown, and the screen where it will be shown.
It references both the Movies and Screens tables through foreign keys (MovieID and ScreenID), ensuring that each show corresponds to an existing movie and a valid screen in a theatre.

CREATE TABLE Shows (
    ShowID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ShowTime TIME NOT NULL,
    Date DATE NOT NULL,
    MovieID INT,
    ScreenID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (MovieID) REFERENCES Movie(MovieID),
    FOREIGN KEY (ScreenID) REFERENCES Screen(ScreenID)
);

-- Sample Data
INSERT INTO Shows (ShowID, ShowTime, Date, MovieID, ScreenID) VALUES
(1, '12:00:00', '2024-10-01', 1, 1),
(2, '6:00:00', '2024-10-01', 2, 2);

Each row in this table represents a single booking, identified by a unique BookingID, and contains details about the show for which the tickets are booked (ShowID) and the number of seats booked (SeatsBooked).
CREATE TABLE Bookings (
    BookingID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ShowID INT,
    SeatsBooked INT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (ShowID) REFERENCES Show(ShowID)
);

-- Sample Data
INSERT INTO Bookings (BookingID, ShowID, SeatsBooked) VALUES
(1, 1, 5),
(2, 2, 3);
